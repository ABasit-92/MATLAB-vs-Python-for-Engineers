# MATLAB-vs-Python-for-Engineers
MATLAB vs Python, simple codes. Which is easier and neater ?!

MATLAB for years has been a very popular choice for engineers because of its vast capabilities purposefully built for engineering problems. In addition, MATLAB also has one of the simplest syntaxes making it quite beginner-friendly. Python since the turn of the millennium has gained popularity because of its use in Artificial Intelligence, and related applications. Python arguably is the most beginner-friendly programming language right now. 

This repository is a comparison meant as a guide for people who are curious how the code of the two programming languages fare with each other for a common problem. 

The MATLAB codes were part of the **Mathematics for Engineers** Specialization offered on the Coursera platform. The excellent course is led by Professor Jefferey R. Chasnov, Department of Mathematics at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
