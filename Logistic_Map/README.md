### Description
The logistic equation  $x_{n+1} = \mu x_n (1 - x_n)$ is a mathematical model for population growth. Where $\mu$ is called the growth rate parameter. 

In Chaos theory, logistic equation demonstrates chaotic behavior, where small changes in initial conditions lead to vastly different outcomes. This sensitivity to initial conditions is a hallmark of chaotic systems.

### MATLAB or Python
In this case, it doesn't make a difference which one chooses. It is mainly a for-loop. MATLAB might have a slight edge in ease of making the visualizations, but not one that gives a clear advantage.
